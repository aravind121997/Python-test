Hereâ€™s a rewritten version of the goals in a simpler format:

1. I will ensure stakeholders are satisfied by providing high-quality data (raw, enriched, and curated) for analysis, monitoring, and exploration.


2. I will make data ingestion into the Cybersecurity Data Lake more stable and reliable for all data zones.


3. I will enhance the onboarding process for internal data ingestion to the Data Lake by improving communication with stakeholders.


4. I will improve Azure resource policies and set up better alerts to lower costs and improve stability.


5. I will optimize data pipelines in Kula using the latest tools and best practices to reduce expenses.


6. I will obtain certifications in Data Engineering and cybersecurity to stay updated with the latest technologies and standards.


7. I will develop new pipelines to improve infrastructure and ensure the stability of the Cybersecurity Data Lake.
