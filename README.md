Here are some in-depth Python questions focused on scalability and handling high data volumes for a Lead Data Engineer interview:

## Python Scalability & High-Volume Data Handling

1. Explain how you would optimize a Python-based ETL pipeline that needs to process 10+ TB of data daily. What specific libraries, techniques, and architecture choices would you make?

2. How would you implement a memory-efficient Python solution to process datasets that are larger than available RAM? Walk through your approach with specific code examples.

3. Compare and contrast Pandas, Dask, and PySpark for large-scale data processing. In what scenarios would you choose one over the others, and what are the performance implications of each?

4. Describe your experience with Python's multiprocessing and asyncio libraries. How would you implement a scalable worker pattern to parallelize data processing tasks with proper error handling and monitoring?

5. How would you design a Python-based streaming data processing system capable of handling 100,000+ events per second? What libraries and architectural patterns would you employ?

6. Explain your approach to profiling and optimizing Python code for data-intensive applications. What tools do you use to identify bottlenecks, and what are common optimization techniques you've applied?

7. How would you implement a distributed caching mechanism in Python to accelerate repetitive data operations? Provide specific examples of libraries and implementation details.

8. Describe how you would use Python to implement a data partitioning strategy for extremely large datasets. What factors would influence your partitioning approach?

9. What strategies do you employ when writing Python code that needs to interface with both relational databases and NoSQL systems at scale? How do you optimize database connections and query execution?

10. Explain your approach to implementing backpressure mechanisms in Python data pipelines to handle variable load and prevent system overload.

11. How would you implement efficient real-time aggregations on high-velocity data streams using Python? What data structures and algorithms would you use?

12. Discuss the challenges of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in high-throughput data processing applications and your strategies for mitigating its impact.

13. How would you design a fault-tolerant, distributed Python application for processing mission-critical data? What patterns and libraries would you use to ensure reliability and recoverability?

14. Explain how you would use Python with Azure Functions to implement a scalable, serverless data processing architecture. What design patterns would you apply to handle varying loads efficiently?

15. Describe your experience optimizing Python code to leverage GPU acceleration for data processing tasks. What libraries and techniques have you found most effective?
