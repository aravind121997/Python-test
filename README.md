I'll prepare a comprehensive set of questions for a Lead Data Engineer interview with a focus on Azure Data Engineering and the broader data engineering landscape. These questions will assess both technical expertise and leadership capabilities.

## Technical Azure Data Engineering Questions

1. How would you design a modern data architecture in Azure to handle both batch and real-time data processing? Discuss the specific services you would use and why.

2. Describe your experience implementing and optimizing Azure Synapse Analytics. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

3. Compare and contrast Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics. In what scenarios would you choose one over the others?

4. How would you implement a data governance strategy using Azure Purview? What are the key components you would focus on?

5. Explain your approach to implementing CI/CD for Azure data pipelines. What tools and practices do you recommend?

6. How would you design a solution for handling sensitive data in Azure while ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA?

7. What's your experience with Azure Cosmos DB? How would you design a solution that leverages its multi-model capabilities?

8. Describe how you would implement a data lake solution in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. What folder structure and security model would you employ?

## Broader Data Engineering Questions

9. How do you approach data quality and validation in large-scale data pipelines? What tools and methodologies have you found effective?

10. Describe your experience with stream processing technologies. How would you design a solution to handle millions of events per second with minimal latency?

11. What strategies do you employ for optimizing Spark jobs? How do you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks?

12. How do you approach data modeling for different types of analytical workloads (OLAP vs. OLTP)?

13. Explain the concept of data mesh and how you would implement it in a large organization.

14. How do you handle schema evolution in data pipelines without disrupting downstream consumers?

15. What's your approach to monitoring and alerting for data pipelines? What metrics do you consider most important?

## Leadership and Architecture Questions

16. How would you transition a team from traditional ETL processes to modern ELT approaches using Azure services?

17. Describe a situation where you had to make significant architectural changes to an existing data platform. How did you manage the technical and organizational challenges?

18. How do you balance technical debt with the need to deliver new features in a data engineering team?

19. How would you approach building a self-service data platform for business users while maintaining governance and security?

20. Describe your experience leading complex data migration projects. What were the key success factors and lessons learned?

21. How do you stay current with the rapidly evolving Azure data services and the broader data engineering ecosystem?

22. How would you structure a data engineering team to support multiple business units with diverse requirements?

23. Describe your approach to mentoring junior data engineers and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

## Case Study Questions

24. Your company needs to migrate from an on-premises data warehouse to Azure. The current solution processes 5TB of data daily with SLAs requiring availability of reports by 8AM. Design a migration strategy and target architecture.

25. You're tasked with implementing a real-time analytics solution that combines streaming IoT data with historical data in Azure. What architecture would you propose, and what specific challenges would you anticipate?

26. Your data lake contains petabytes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Design a solution to make this data discoverable, accessible, and valuable to business users.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these questions or focus on a specific area of data engineering for the interview?
