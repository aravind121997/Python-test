I'd be happy to help you create a Databricks SQL query to identify missing dates in a dataset. This is a common data quality check that helps ensure your time series data is complete.

Let me create a SQL query that you can use in Databricks to find missing dates within a specified date range:

```sql
WITH date_series AS (
  SELECT date_add('2023-01-01', s.id) AS date
  FROM (
    SELECT explode(sequence(0, datediff('2023-12-31', '2023-01-01'))) AS id
  ) s
),
your_data AS (
  -- Replace this with your actual table and date column
  SELECT DISTINCT date_column AS date 
  FROM your_table_name
  WHERE date_column BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
)
SELECT 
  ds.date AS missing_date
FROM date_series ds
LEFT JOIN your_data yd ON ds.date = yd.date
WHERE yd.date IS NULL
ORDER BY missing_date;
```

This query works in the following way:

1. First, it creates a complete series of dates (`date_series`) between a start and end date (currently set to 2023-01-01 to 2023-12-31)
2. Then it creates a second CTE (`your_data`) that gets all unique dates from your actual table
3. Finally, it performs a left join from the complete date series to your data and finds all dates that don't have a match

To use this query:
1. Replace `your_table_name` with your actual table name
2. Replace `date_column` with the name of the column that contains your dates
3. Adjust the date range ('2023-01-01' and '2023-12-31') to match your specific needs

Would you like me to modify this query for a specific date range or with additional conditions?
